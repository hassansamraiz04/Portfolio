# Portfolio
I created a personal portfolio website using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me explore the basics of responsive web design and structure.  The website includes:  🧑‍💻 A profile and introduction section  🛠️ A visual grid of my top 5 skills  🎯 A hobby showcase with icons  📩 A contact form with a JavaScript popup on submission
